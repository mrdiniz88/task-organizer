# task-organizer
I was creating many tasks and ended up losing myself at the time of studying, started studying one thing, saw another, did not complete the studies in what I was and went to another, it hindered me, so I decided to develop a system to organize my projects and tasks.

This system was developed with the python language using the django framework, so I will make available the site I developed in this application and an API for developers interested in consumila in a more pleasant design.
